        Making Moves: Crescenta Valley Dancer Lina Kim and LSK
      </h1>
    </div>

    <p style="text-align: center">
      Though the Greater Los Angeles area is home to a overwhelmingly large and
      prominent dance community, one La Crescenta student has made an incredible
      effort to unite and inspire dancers around her. Angelina Kim, a
      seventeen-year-old student from the Crescenta Valley High School, began
      her dance journey just ten years ago. In this time, Kim has used her
      experiences and knowledge from years of dancing to contribute to the
      surrounding dance community.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
      At the age of seven, Kim first began dancing after finding herself
      inspired by videos of dancers such as Matt Stefanina and Kyle Hanagami.
      Since then, she has been finding ways to improve her skills and broaden
      her dance experience. In 2021, she joined Crescenta Valley High School’s
      competitive dance team as a freshman and, just two years later, went on to
      lead the team as a captain.

    <p style="text-align: center">
      However, these accomplishments were not enough. With a whirling sense of
      creativity, Kim wanted to work toward something greater. After spending
      her entire high school career competing and dancing with students from
      various schools in the community, Kim decided to collaborate with and
      unite her fellow dancers. Called Elezkay (or LSK), Kim started a group
      with a select few dancers from various teams in the community, including
      her own. “I’ve been so grateful and lucky to be able to meet so many
      different people, whether that’s coaches or students and dancers,” she
      says, “And I was like, why not just bring everyone together in that way?”
      With dancers from Crescenta Valley High School, PV Peninsula High School,
      and Elements Dance Space, the first Elezkay routine was curated to be
      competed at Grand Stand Dance Competition in Huntington Beach.

    <p style="text-align: center">
      This first step for Elezkay paved the way for further projects. Currently,
      Kim is working toward a new set of choreography, involving 23 dancers from
      all over the local dance community. She explains that, “We don’t always
      have to be separated by teams and forced to butt-heads with each other,
      compete against each other. It’s more than that. We do make a genuine
      connection with each other and we share something, which is dance.”
      Elezkay will be competing for the second time on Nov. 17th at Maxt Out, a
      competition taking place at Glendale High School.

      Kim highlights her growth as a dancer, instructor, and leader throughout
      this process, stating that, “It takes a lot of time. It’s a lot of
      responsibility, too…I’m so grateful and lucky that these people trust me
      and I need to meet those expectations and meet those standards.” These
      skills prove important for pursuing dance in the future, a concept that
      “wasn’t originally in [her] plan.” She adds, “I realized this is something
      I want to do for the rest of my life. And I don’t know exactly what that
      entails yet…but all I know is, I just want to keep dancing.”
