        Perseverance Through Hardship: Fulfilling... or Not
      </h1>

    <p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 40px">
      Elite athletes encounter distinctive workplace stressors, including
      heightened public scrutiny via social media, less support networks, and
      career-ending injuries (Rice, et al). Whether athletes face mental health
      setbacks, or physical injuries like constant nosebleeds, they must
      evaluate the value of persevering, or not, in the presence of hardship.
      Perseverance, often celebrated as a key driver of success, is a quality
      able to guide individuals toward their goals despite setbacks. However,
      the concept is not universally the same among individuals or situations
      but rather exhibits variety. Understanding this complex approach is
      essential to help navigate personal and professional pursuits through
      valuable goals, whether it's in sports like swimming or gymnastics.
      Generally, the issue of perseverance affects many individuals in areas of
      life, especially athleticism, education, career, relationships, and
      personal development. For instance, an employee’s career advancement and
      job satisfaction may improve from perseverance, or lead to the stress of
      continuing struggle. In a specific view, athletes face the multifaceted
      pathway of choosing when to persevere. Essentially, athletes face
      difficulty frequently, as they are constantly trying new tricks,
      practicing for hours, and participating in competitive games against
      others. Therefore, we must consider their stressful lifestyle, and how to
      combat their concerns regarding when to persevere through mental or
      physical hardships.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
      The issue of perseverance is debated among psychologists, educators,
      employers, and individuals grappling with personal and professional
      challenges. To lead athletes to success in their sport, coaches, in
      particular, must establish a strong bond and understanding with them as
      individuals beyond their athletic abilities. Athletes often see their
      coaches as role models, proving the lasting impact of coach guidance in
      fostering perseverance and supporting decisions for athletes’ growth. Some
      researchers argue that perseverance is essential to athletic success,
      citing its role in overcoming obstacles, achieving long-term goals, and
      creating higher-quality performance and improved characteristic traits.
      Conversely, others contend forced persistence can lead to further struggle
      in sports, advocating the importance of adaptability and knowing the
      appropriate situations to persevere. Taking into account these
      complexities, researchers advocate for the creation of straightforward
      goals, with the consideration of value and purpose. Athletes must weigh
      the advantages and disadvantages of perseverance in situations and assess
      which goals must be abandoned for the sake of physical or mental
      well-being. Freelance scriptwriter and researcher, Brandi Ortiz, mentions,
      “Remind yourself that not everyone is born to excel at everything. What is
      important is that you try and persevere through the pain, but also allow
      yourself grace” (Ortiz). Her statement promotes a balanced approach to
      personal growth, where perseverance is great for developing character
      traits and performance qualities, but could also lead to further, negative
      struggles. She incorporates the phrase, “allow yourself grace”, to
      encourage prioritizing physical and mental well-being when choosing
      between persevering. This debate is crucial in influencing how individuals
      approach challenges, make decisions, and pursue their aspirations.
      Therefore, this leads us to ask, how can athletes in the United States
      understand their mental or physical boundaries before persevering through
      hardship? Overall, athletes should persevere in their pursuits after
      considering the wide range of potential outcomes and evaluating the
      overall value of choosing perseverance.

    <h2>The Variety of Outcomes</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center">
      Athletes must recognize the various outcomes that may arise from
      persisting in sports since success is never guaranteed. However,
      perseverance remains essential in fulfilling success, empowering
      individuals to diligently practice towards their goals to better their
      skill set and overall performance quality. In fact, Dr. Daniel Gucciardi,
      a Psychology Professor, states, “Mental toughness represents as a
      psychological capacity to deliver high performance on a regular basis
      despite varying degrees of situational demands” (Gucciardi, et al).
      Gucciardi highlights the significance of perseverance through the use of
      mental toughness, an attribute that enables individuals to consistently
      achieve high levels of performance, regardless of any diverse pressures.
      Hence, a successful outcome of perseverance includes the skill improvement
      of athletes. Additionally, alongside the betterment of performance
      quality, perseverance leaves athletes with improved characteristic traits.
      In a coach-oriented study of college football experiences, Kathleen
      Bachynski, an Assistant Professor of Public Health, analyzes that,
      “Seemingly minor injuries were considered negligible in comparison to such
      values as courage, discipline, and loyalty that coaches believed football
      imparted” (Bachynski 379). Coaches find that the benefits of participating
      in football, including the listed moral qualities, outweigh the risks
      associated with small, physical injuries. Therefore, athletes and their
      guardians realize that while athletics risk harm, amazing attributes are
      offered, like discipline, inducing improved personal development. While
      perseverance provides benefits like higher performance quality and
      improved character traits, forced perseverance often leads to further
      struggle in other considerations. Jim Lord, the Director of Education and
      Programs at USA Cheer, recounts, “My perseverance in trying to play soccer
      despite failing vision wasn’t going to be realistic or fulfilling. And
      because I kept pushing... I developed obsessive compulsive disorder, an
      eating disorder, and depression” (Lord). While the previous studies
      emphasized the positive role of perseverance, Lord’s personal experience
      demonstrates how his inability to determine the outcome resulted in
      detrimental effects on his mental health and overall well-being. His
      assertion considers the difficulty of determining the outcome so far
      beforehand. Essentially, Lord counters the ineffectiveness of predicting
      potential outcomes, citing the unpredictability of the journey and its
      final destination. Nonetheless, the unpredictability of outcomes should
      pose a higher necessity for closer examination into the goals athletes
      choose to persevere through, as they must best prevent negative outcomes.
      Through the above evidence, perseverance is perceived as a beneficial tool
      that can provide consistently high performance in games, and teach
      valuable lessons of courage, discipline, and loyalty that coaches believe
      outweigh the minor injuries. However, another author proves the ability of
      perseverance to negatively impact one’s life, especially due to their
      failure to determine the outcome beforehand.

    <h2>The Worth of Goals: Considering the Purpose</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center">
      Establishing clear goals and direction is crucial in promoting athletic
      resilience and passion, emphasizing purposefulness. Alongside the idea of
      considering the potential outcomes, athletes must weigh the pros and cons
      of reasoning if a goal is valuable and worthy of persistence. Dr. Patrick
      Hill, a Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences, describes, “Finding
      a direction for life and knowing which life goals to strive toward should
      build a greater perseverance and passion for these goals” (Hill, et al).
      Dr. Hill's research encourages the importance of finding a direction for
      life and recognizing which goals are worth striving toward. Essentially,
      goals must be evaluated for clarity and purposefulness, so athletes
      determine which ones to prioritize or abandon for the sake of health.
      Furthermore, in the novel, Through the Tunnel, a direct experience of
      selecting worthy goals comes into play. Doris Lessing, a British novelist,
      illustrates a young boy’s determination and set goals by mentioning, "That
      day and the next, Jerry exercised his lungs as if everything, the whole of
      his life, all that he would become, depended upon it. Again his nose bled
      at night...” (Lessing 20). Since Jerry believes in the worthiness of
      mastering in underwater breathing, he establishes a systematic approach
      through consistent, daily practice. Driven by his belief in the purpose of
      persevering through his goal, he demonstrates perseverance, even while
      facing physical challenges such as constant nosebleeds. Nonetheless, while
      some individuals are devoted and analyze worth in persevering for a goal,
      athletes should refrain from exceeding their mental and physical
      boundaries when deemed uncomfortable. Marcus Thompson, a lead columnist at
      The Athletic, determines, “Sports culture dictates that Biles was supposed
      to power through the doubt, face the anxiety and deliver us a moment for
      which we can endow her with that special honor we bequeath to the
      courageous” (Thompson). Essentially, Simone Biles is incredibly committed
      to keeping her fans satisfied with her performances, but before her
      competition, she prioritized her mental health over her image in the
      athletic standards. Her actions were extraordinary, especially considering
      how Dr. James Bauman, Researcher of Sports Performance, mentions that if
      athletes struggle with mental health, they are often labeled as “mentally
      weak” and exclusion often follows (Bauman). This represents the
      vulnerability that must be overcome to prioritize well-being over social
      reputation. Even if her event and goal were purposeful to attend, she
      proves that risking health is not worth the drive. However, to contradict
      this, athletes must set more realistic goals and have self-awareness of
      their capabilities, so they identify the events they will attend
      beforehand. Through two of the sources, an effective way to identify the
      best goals for perseverance is by considering the worth and overall
      purpose of one’s journey by setting clear goals and working after those
      that provoke meaning. However, the last source considers an account where
      even purposeful goals should be closely evaluated for worthiness. In this
      counter perspective, the competition is not worth risking the athlete’s
      mental health, so she proved the effectiveness of considering goals before
      persevering.
    </p>

    <h2>Coaching as a Tool for Perserverance</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 100px">
      Reflecting on the complex viewpoints of many researchers, the most
      effective method to combat the choice of perseverance is coach guidance
      and check-ins. At times, perseverance as an athlete leads to satisfaction
      and success in life achievements; however, it also brings additional
      pressure in other scenarios. Essentially, individuals must consider the
      potential outcomes and value of goals when determining the worthiness of
      persevering through hardship. The solution of coach involvement is
      impactful on these athletes, as feedback and care from athletic mentors
      provide an external view of the benefits and drawbacks of choosing to
      persevere or cease the journey. Feedback from an external perspective,
      like a coach, is crucial as individuals not directly involved in a
      situation may identify important factors that originally went unnoticed.
      Coach guidance is best implemented using training programs that teach
      athletes’ mentors the ability to determine mental and physical issues
      before encouraging perseverance from their players. This solution would be
      implemented most successfully by school districts and college
      administration for student-athletes, or organization boards for private
      club-affiliated athletes. Dr. Stewart Vella, an Associate Psychology
      Professor, alongside others, depicts that coach intervention provides
      strategies for coaches to support their players’ psychological needs,
      including autonomy, competence, and relatedness. It consisted of two
      face-to-face workshops, two mentoring sessions... plus 11 self-paced
      online modules (Vella, et al.). Therefore, coaches are trained to help
      determine mental health issues within their athletes and provide valuable
      resources to guide them along the path of perseverance. Other researchers
      also agree with the effectiveness of incorporating coaches into the
      solution. James Bissett, an Athletic Researcher from the University of
      Toronto, and his team state that, “Coaches in many cases are also able to
      communicate with athletes in a trusted manner... As such, both athletes
      and parents identify coaches as suitable gatekeepers for helping connect
      athletes to... health services” (Bissett, et al.). Bissett’s statement
      directly supports Vella’s research regarding the immense effectiveness of
      the coach training programs as he claims that coach communication should
      be prioritized, especially as they contain many resources for mental and
      physical health support. Therefore, the utilization of workshops,
      mentoring sessions, and online modules should increase the potential of
      coaches when helping their athletes break out of physical and mental
      hardship. Overall, perseverance remains a component that involves lots of
      obstacles throughout, but coach guidance from education programs provides
      individuals with an external perspective on the pathway or suggests a
      cease to their persistence.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
      A major limitation alongside the solution of coach training is engagement
      and completion. If the program is mandated by policy-makers, the
      establishment of rules ensuring participation from all coaches becomes
      necessary. However, if the program stays optional, there is no guarantee
      of engagement from all participants. Dr. Vella clarifies, “Eight
      coaches... also took part in the coach education component. All coaches
      attended the first workshop and completed the first online module;
      however, only one coach completed all modules” (Vella, et al.). The
      completion of all modules by only one coach suggests potential limitations
      regarding engagement or completion rates among coaches, which could impact
      the effectiveness of the training. Limited participation or incompletion
      may diminish the intended impact of the program on coaches’ ability to
      effectively support athletes’ psychological needs. It would help to
      implement more flexible scheduling options for workshops and online
      modules to increase accessibility, and also establish mandatory deadlines
      for completion if the program is compulsory.

    <p style="text-align: center">
      On the other hand, constant check-ins regarding their athletes’ well-being
      have positive implications as it creates a stronger bond between the coach
      and athlete. Additionally, athletes will receive resources from their
      coaches, such as psychologists or physical therapists to help fix their
      physical and mental struggles. Most importantly, feedback from an outside
      perspective will provide new lights to look at certain situations
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 70px">
      In essence, potential outcomes can be successful or induce consequences,
      so it is important to closely analyze and predict the journey of
      perseverance. Furthermore, athletes must consider the purpose of
      persisting, prioritizing their personal health. As an effective solution,
      two researchers argue for the incorporation of coaches as gateways to
      health resources. Training programs should educate coaches to identify
      their athletes’ conditions in order to support their decisions in
      persevering. Hence, athletes should persevere in their aspirations after
      considering the variety of potential outcomes, alongside evaluating the
      purpose and value of persevering in a situation with the collaborative
      guidance of coaches.
