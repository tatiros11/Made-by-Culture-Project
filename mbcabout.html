    <p>
      Welcome to Made by Culture, a dynamic online magazine that celebrates the
      intersection of STEM and the arts. We are a platform created by and for
      students and young adults in the greater Los Angeles and Glendale areas,
      showcasing the incredible achievements, opportunities, and events that
      shape our communities. At Made by Culture, we believe in the power of both
      scientific and artistic innovation. Our platform highlights journalistic
      articles and offers a space for youth to submit their own creative
      works—from poetry and research papers to photography, art, and
      design—giving them an opportunity to share their talents with the world.
      Our mission is to bridge the gap between innovation and creativity by
      embracing the importance of both STEM and the humanities. By doing so, we
      hope to inspire the next generation of thinkers and creators, helping them
      to understand that both fields are essential to shaping our future.
